				<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
Armin's Catering was founded by Armin Dastoor back in 2004.  Armin was born and brought up in Mumbai and started learning to cook her native Parsi food with her mother at the age of eight. Armin learned all her cooking skills and secrets at her mother's knee and then further developed her repertoire after getting married and cooking for family and friends. 
<p>

<p>
After a successful career in retail banking, and encouraged by clients for whom she had catered on a part-time basis since 1991, Armin decided to take the plunge and start Armin's Catering working full-time at producing her delicious food.  Over the years, her fledgling business has grown into a successful family-run business employing up to forty staff on event days, and she has cooked for such luminaries as HRH The Duke of Edinburgh and the Archbishop of Canterbury.
</p>
 
<p>
Once you have sampled the delights of Armin's cooking, it's hard to resist and many of her loyal clients return to her again and again to cater for all their celebrations.  Please take a look at our <a href="testimonials.html">testimonials</a> to see how happy our clients are with our service.
